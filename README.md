# mycustomAdapter Class for PlanetApp
The mycustomAdapter class is a custom ArrayAdapter designed for the PlanetApp Android application. It facilitates the display of planet data in a custom list view (ListView), showing images and details for each planet.

**Key Features:**
  - Custom Layout Handling: Utilizes a custom layout (item_list_layout.xml) for each item in the list.
  - Dynamic Data Binding: Binds data from the Planet model class to the corresponding views in the layout.
  - ViewHolder Pattern: Implements the ViewHolder pattern for efficient view recycling in the getView method.
  - Context Awareness: Utilizes the Android Context to inflate layouts and access resources.
    
**Usage:**
  - The mycustomAdapter class is instantiated with an ArrayList<Planet> and a Context, enabling it to adapt to dynamic changes in data and efficiently manage the display of planet information.
